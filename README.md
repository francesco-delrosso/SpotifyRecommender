## 📖 **Introduction**

**Spotify Recommender** is an innovative **JavaFX desktop application** that helps users discover new music through a combination of **personal preferences** and **social connections**.

The system analyzes the songs a user has marked as favorites and cross-references them with their friends’ preferences to deliver **personalized, socially-informed music recommendations**.

By blending **collaborative filtering** (suggestions based on similar users) and **content-based filtering** (suggestions based on liked tracks), Spotify Recommender creates a dynamic, community-driven listening experience — inspired by the spirit of Spotify itself.
